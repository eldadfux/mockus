# Mockus
---
Stop wasting time mocking APIs. MockIt gives you an interface to configure and create REAL mocked endpoints for your applications. Whilst you wait for APIS to be built use MockIt to talk to a real service.

---
## The problem
When building applications you often need to interact with services. When the services are not ready to be consumed you have a few options:

- Mock out the response with a JSON file
- Create a mock service yourself
- Use Mockus.

## This Solution
This tool was designed to help developers quickly create endpoints for their applications. No need to create a server, just run this project locally. You can create, edit and manage routes to your API. Every change to the API will be reflected on the server and updated straight away.
