## The problem
When you want to run integrations tests, or just want to build your app independently without any active backend, you have few options:

- Mock out the response with a JSON file
- Create a mock service yourself
- Use Mockus!

## This Solution
This tool was designed to help developers and qa testers quickly create endpoints for their applications. No need to create a server, just run this project localy. You can create, edit and manage routes to your API. Every change to the API will be reflected on the server and updated straight away.
